It‘s not just any motocross race, but the oldest and one of the most prestigious in the United States. Hangtown is the opening round of the 12-race Lucas Oil Pro Motocross Championship sanctioned by the AMA.
Every year, there is a new battle to witness, and new champions to crown. Perhaps it's the mystique of 50 years of racing, dating back before the series was even established, that makes Hangtown racing legendary. Many people say that attending Hangtown is a way to be a part of motorcross history.

  Racing gets underway at 9am, with some of the best amateurs in the country doing battle. In the afternoon, the top pros will be riding on the track for their series media day. Later on Thursday night, join us at the Palladio Mall in Folsom from 5 - 7pm for a Hangtown pre-party. Amateur racing continues on Friday, May 18 at 9am, when the top experts and Pro Am's compete for pro points, which leads to a professional license in the premier professional series.

  Prepare to be pampered in the Superticket area with food and drinks, start-line seating, all-day pit passes, and great swag. The Superticket area, along with other hospitality areas, are limited in number, and sell out every year so don't wait!  Many of the hospitality areas include an all-day pit pass, which makes these hospitality areas an experience like no other. With many different ticket choices to choose from, and some with limited seating, make your selection online and beat the rush.
